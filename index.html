                     Pocket Pennant Run was created as a result of two guys’ longing for something incredibly simple, yet addictingly fun. I, myself, only recently got into the world of tabletop gaming; I stumbled across the community as a result the COVID pandemic. Back in March 2020, my wife and I started playing board games to pass all the newfound time we had. This new interest in board gaming, along with my lifelong love of baseball, led to the creation of my first board game Small Ball, which is a press-your-luck baseball dice game aimed at fans who enjoy the strategies and decisions involved in the game of baseball. As I began promoting the game online, I found a number of communities that took tabletop baseball gaming very seriously. It was in observing these communities that I learned about games such as Strat-O-Matic, APBA, Statis Pro, History Maker, and more; all games I had frankly never heard of before.

                     One of the games I found an early attraction to was Deadball, a relatively new player on the baseball simulation circuit, created by W.M. Akers. The simplicity and ease of play drew me in: all that was required to play was Akers’ book, a scorecard, and some basic player stats. I played mostly by myself, replaying classic series, for a few months until I found an online community. In late 2020, shortly after I joined that community, I participated in a Deadball league, led by my future business partner and friend, Craig Harris. At the conclusion of the league, Craig asked if I’d like to work with him to co-lead another league. Together, we looked over the rules of Deadball and started making our own league-specific tweaks and changes. During that time, I learned that Craig was an accomplished computer programmer and had created supplemental software for Deadball that would generate player stats, pre-filled scorecards, and simulate games.

                     As Craig and I worked through the rules for our upcoming Deadball league, we kept returning to a common theme: keep it simple. Maybe it was our lack of patience, but neither of us enjoyed playing games that took 60+ minutes to complete and required constant shuffling of cards, charts, or binders. As we refined the rules of our league, we began challenging ourselves to boil things down, to figure out how could we simplify the rules without compromising the integrity of the game? I found the process of discovering more efficient ways of doing things to be incredibly fulfilling and enjoyable. Also around that time, I stumbled across a quote by French writer and poet Antoine de Saint-Exupery on a board game design forum that really struck a chord with me:                  </p>
                  <h4>
                     “Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.”
                  </h4>
                  <p>
                  All these things led me to a question that ultimately became the cornerstone of what Pocket Pennant Run: What is the simplest baseball simulation game one could create and still achieve realistic results? It was a challenge I wanted to take on. With that, around May of 2021, I began studying all the baseball games I could find. During this process, I was consistently impressed with the games that did “more with less”, especially the games that had the smallest footprints. Famous Fastballs (Famous Games Company Inc.), for example, uses 11 poker-sized cards and a handful of coins and has a unique rock-paper-scissors approach to resolving at bats. Back to Basics Baseball (Downey Games) boils all the outcomes and charts down to a set of fast-action cards that the player simply flips. As I learned about the clever ways in which these, and many other games, managed to get a full baseball experience with just a few components, some ideas for a game of my own began formulating.

                     Early on, the game consisted of ten small charts on two pages of paper for things such as the pitcher, batter, power swings, bunts, and more. Eventually, we took away two of the charts and fit them all on one sheet of paper. The first few iterations of the game also included various dice combinations: two d20s - one for the pitcher and one for the batter, then two d8s added together. Ultimately, we found three d12 dice to be the perfect balance. We also settled on a four-point, letter-grade (“A” through “D”) rating system for batters in four different categories - batting, power, speed, and defense - each of which is based on common statistics, such as batting average (batting) and stolen bases (speed). Pitchers would be rated in four categories as well – fatigue, pitching, control, and defense.

                     As mentioned earlier, Craig is a very accomplished software developer. His main goal was to create a unique piece of software to accompany the physical game so that players could simulate and replay games across the entire history of professional baseball. In Craig’s software, users can load a team from the database and build custom lineups that can be saved for later. Once a few lineups have been built, users can simply choose a home and away team, choose a saved lineup, pick the starting pitchers, and a custom, pre-filled scorecard is generated, ready to be printed or loaded to a tablet. Another feature of the software is the ability to print roster cards, which are poker card-sized sheets that give a gamer an at-a-glance look at the team’s starting lineup, bench, rotation, and bullpen. The game comes with eight pre-printed roster cards, but with the software, a user can print an unlimited number of roster cards to cut out at home.
